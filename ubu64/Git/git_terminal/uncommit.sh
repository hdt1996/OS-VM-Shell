#GIT COMMANDS
#	Rebase
#		Goal: Place current "checked out" branch ahead of ahead of "onto" branch
#		Process:
#			1) Find common ancestor between branches
#			2) Get diff between "checked out" branch and "onto" branch
#			3) Place diff commits after "onto" branch (merging to single)
#			4) Checked out branch should be to right of "onto" branch
#			5) If the result is a single linear line of commits 
#			   We can check out the "onto" branch and call merge
#				Head pointer simply moves -> AKA fast-forward

	cr - commit rebase: Chosen commit's changes be wiped from history
			    Useful if chosen commit shows unauthorized data
	    IMPORTANT: Commits created after chosen commit will have their 
	    	       histories merged with newest revert commit. This will 
	    	       make these commits nonexistent while the changes from 
	    	       them persist. Potential risk is that one of the newer
	    	       commits being dependent on the one we are removing.
	    	       We can always use reflog to revert to previous version
	    	       of branch.
